# Advent of Code 2024
Author: Alex Sinner | alex@sinner.lu


These are my scrappy attempts to solve Advent of Code (AoC) challenges for 2024.
Each day comes with a new problem to solve. Each problem has 2 parts, where the 2nd part is unlocked after successfully solving the first. 

*Disclaimer* All code is written with the goal to solve the problem, not to look nice, be well-documented, well-tested, etc. I have been using Visual Studio with the Amazon Q developer plugin to help with the occasional autocompletion and brainstorming in interactive mode. All solutions are designed by human intelligence (or the lack thereof) though.

## Code structure
All Python code is found under ./src 
I follow the convention of calling each file *aoc24_DDa.py* for the first part and *aoc24_DDb.py* for the second. I am not adding the input files to version control, but they are all saved under ./data as *aoc24_input_DD.txt.
Any helper modules are also stored in ./src, but with no specific naming convention.

Enjoy, and don't blame me if someone is training their AI on my code!
